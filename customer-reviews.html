  <h1>James' Customer Satisfaction</h1>

  <div class="review">
    ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
    Upon meeting this man I thought he was 18. Turns out he was like 25 or something. Minus a star for deception. Turned out to be a relatively funny man, accompanied me to Lidl during Jake’s drawn out socials. Highly recommend driving with him at peak road rage – adds significant entertainment to otherwise boring journeys. Did kick Harry out of the tent in the Alps but as a wise man – actually given Jake said this maybe not a wise man – a man once said “Pussy is Pussy” so we can let that slide. Wanted an extra year in Cardiff doing fuck all which at this point I can back. Overall 4 out of 5 man. Needs improvement in the aging department (face isn’t even though hairline is) but overall would recommend.

    Assumed portion sizes were big due to the size of the establishment but was very disappointed to receive 2 baby potatoes and a small sausage

    ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  
    Overall, I’m quite satisfied with the James product. James is quite versatile and has a range of skills from Tesco delivery services to sexual antics in tents. Would recommend that when receiving a James that you check for any obstructions in the legs and ankles as that is quite common and this is why I’m deducting a star. However apart from that I’d say he’s a sturdy piece of equipment in reasonable condition and looks pretty solid in both the brunette and blonde style.

    ⭐️⭐️⭐️  
    I have never seen a man rage at an inanimate object quite like James raging at the Tourneo for not working in Briancon. The passion was attractive but I was also scared for my life.
