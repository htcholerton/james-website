  <h1>James' Customer Satisfaction</h1>

  <div class="review">
    ⭐⭐⭐⭐  
    Upon meeting this man I thought he was 18. Turns out he was like 25 or something. Minus a star for deception. Turned out to be a relatively funny man, accompanied me to Lidl during Jake’s drawn out socials. Highly recommend driving with him at peak road rage – adds significant entertainment to otherwise boring journeys. Did kick Harry out of the tent in the Alps but as a wise man – actually given Jake said this maybe not a wise man – a man once said “Pussy is Pussy” so we can let that slide. Wanted an extra year in Cardiff doing fuck all which at this point I can back. Overall 4 out of 5 man. Needs improvement in the aging department (face isn’t even though hairline is) but overall would recommend.

    Assumed portion sizes were big due to the size of the establishment but was very disappointed to receive 2 baby potatoes and a small sausage
